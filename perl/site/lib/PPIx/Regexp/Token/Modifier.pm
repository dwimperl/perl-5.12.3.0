=head1 NAME

PPIx::Regexp::Token::Modifier - Represent modifiers.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PPIx::Regexp::Dumper;
 PPIx::Regexp::Dumper->new( 'qr{foo}smx' )
     ->print();

The trailing C<smx> will be represented by this class.

This class also represents the whole of things like C<(?ismx)>. But the
modifiers in something like C<(?i:foo)> are represented by a
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token::GroupType::Modifier|PPIx::Regexp::Token::GroupType::Modifier>.

=head1 INHERITANCE

C<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Modifier> is a
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token|PPIx::Regexp::Token>.

C<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Modifier> is the parent of
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token::GroupType::Modifier|PPIx::Regexp::Token::GroupType::Modifier>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents modifier characters at the end of the regular
expression.  For example, in C<qr{foo}smx> this class would represent
the terminal C<smx>.

=head2 The C<a>, C<d>, C<l>, and C<u> modifiers

The C<a>, C<d>, C<l>, and C<u> modifiers, introduced into the C<(?...)>
construction in Perl 5.13.6 (or 5.13.9 in the case of /a) are used to
force either Unicode pattern semantics (C<u>), locale semantics (C<l>)
default semantics (C<d> the traditional Perl semantics, which can also
mean 'dual' since it means Unicode if the string's UTF-8 bit is on, and
locale if the UTF-8 bit is off), or restricted default semantics (C<a>).
These are mutually exclusive, and only one can be asserted at a time.
Asserting any of these overrides the inherited value of any of the
others. The C<asserted()> method reports as asserted the last one it
sees, or none of them if it has seen none.

For example, given C<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Modifier> C<$elem>
representing the invalid regular expression fragment C<(?dul)>,
C<< $elem->asserted( 'l' ) >> would return true, but
C<< $elem->asserted( 'u' ) >> would return false. Note that
C<< $elem->negated( 'u' ) >> would also return false, since C<u> is not
explicitly negated.

If C<$elem> represented regular expression fragment C<(?i)>,
C<< $elem->asserted( 'd' ) >> would return false, since even though C<d>
represents the default behavior it is not explicitly asserted.

B<Note> that if this functionality is retracted before Perl 5.14 is
released, support for it will disappear. See L<PPIx::Regexp/NOTICE> for
some explanation.

=head2 The caret (C<^>) modifier

Calling C<^> a modifier is a bit of a misnomer. The C<(?^...)>
construction was introduced in Perl 5.13.6, to prevent the inheritance
of modifiers. The documentation calls the caret a shorthand equivalent
for C<d-imsx>, and that it the way this class handles it.

For example, given C<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Modifier> C<$elem>
representing regular expression fragment C<(?^i)>,
C<< $elem->asserted( 'd' ) >> would return true, since in the absence of
an explicit C<l> or C<u> this class considers the C<^> to explicitly
assert C<d>.

B<Note> that if this is retracted before Perl 5.14 is released, this
support will disappear. See L<PPIx::Regexp/NOTICE> for some explanation.

=head1 METHODS

This class provides the following public methods. Methods not documented
here are private, and unsupported in the sense that the author reserves
the right to change or remove them without notice.

=cut

package PPIx::Regexp::Token::Modifier;

use strict;
use warnings;

use base qw{ PPIx::Regexp::Token };

use PPIx::Regexp::Constant qw{
    MINIMUM_PERL
    MODIFIER_GROUP_MATCH_SEMANTICS
};

our $VERSION = '0.021';

# Define modifiers that are to be aggregated internally for ease of
# computation.
my %aggregate = (
    a	=> MODIFIER_GROUP_MATCH_SEMANTICS,
    aa	=> MODIFIER_GROUP_MATCH_SEMANTICS,
    d	=> MODIFIER_GROUP_MATCH_SEMANTICS,
    l	=> MODIFIER_GROUP_MATCH_SEMANTICS,
    u	=> MODIFIER_GROUP_MATCH_SEMANTICS,
);
my %de_aggregate;
foreach my $value ( values %aggregate ) {
    $de_aggregate{$value}++;
}

=head2 asserts

 $token->asserts( 'i' ) and print "token asserts i";
 foreach ( $token->asserts() ) { print "token asserts $_\n" }

This method returns true if the token explicitly asserts the given
modifier. The example would return true for the modifier in
C<(?i:foo)>, but false for C<(?-i:foo)>.

If called without an argument, or with an undef argument, all modifiers
explicitly asserted by this token are returned.

=cut

sub asserts {
    my ( $self, $modifier ) = @_;
    $self->{modifiers} ||= $self->_decode();
    if ( defined $modifier ) {
	my $bin = $aggregate{$modifier}
	    or return $self->{modifiers}{$modifier};
	return $self->{modifiers}{$bin} eq $modifier;
    } else {
	return ( sort grep { defined $_ && $self->{modifiers}{$_} }
	    map { $de_aggregate{$_} ? $self->{modifiers}{$_} : $_ }
	    keys %{ $self->{modifiers} } );
    }
}

sub can_be_quantified { return };

=head2 match_semantics

 my $sem = $token->match_semantics();
 defined $sem or $sem = 'undefined';
 print "This token has $sem match semantics\n";

This method returns the match semantics asserted by the token, as one of
the letters C<a>, C<d>, C<l>, or C<u>. If no explicit match semantics
are asserted, this method returns C<undef>.

=cut

sub match_semantics {
    my ( $self ) = @_;
    $self->{modifiers} ||= $self->_decode();
    return $self->{modifiers}{ MODIFIER_GROUP_MATCH_SEMANTICS() };
}

=head2 modifiers

 my %mods = $token->modifiers();

Returns all modifiers asserted or negated by this token, and the values
set (true for asserted, false for negated). If called in scalar context,
returns a reference to a hash containing the values.

=cut

sub modifiers {
    my ( $self ) = @_;
    $self->{modifiers} ||= $self->_decode();
    my %mods = %{ $self->{modifiers} };
    foreach my $bin ( keys %de_aggregate ) {
	defined ( my $val = delete $mods{$bin} )
	    or next;
	$mods{$bin} = $val;
    }
    return wantarray ? %mods : \%mods;
}

=head2 negates

 $token->negates( 'i' ) and print "token negates i\n";
 foreach ( $token->negates() ) { print "token negates $_\n" }

This method returns true if the token explicitly negates the given
modifier. The example would return true for the modifier in
C<(?-i:foo)>, but false for C<(?i:foo)>.

If called without an argument, or with an undef argument, all modifiers
explicitly negated by this token are returned.

=cut

sub negates {
    my ( $self, $modifier ) = @_;
    $self->{modifiers} ||= $self->_decode();
    # Note that since the values of hash entries that represent
    # aggregated modifiers will never be false (at least, not unless '0'
    # becomes a modifier) we need no special logic to handle them.
