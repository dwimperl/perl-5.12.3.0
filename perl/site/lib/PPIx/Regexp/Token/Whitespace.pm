C<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Whitespace> is a
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token|PPIx::Regexp::Token>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents whitespace. It will appear inside the regular
expression only if the /x modifier is present, but it may also appear
between the type and the opening delimiter (e.g. C<qr {foo}> or after
the regular expression in a bracketed substitution (e.g. C<s{foo}
{bar}>).

# Return true if the token can be quantified, and false otherwise

# Objects of this class are generated either by the tokenizer itself
# (when scanning for delimiters) or by PPIx::Regexp::Token::Literal (if
# it hits a match for \s and finds the regular expression has the /x
# modifier asserted.
