=head1 NAME

Test::Mock::LWP - Easy mocking of LWP packages

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Make LWP packages to make testing easier.

    use Test::Mock::LWP;

    # Setup fake response content and code
    $Mock_response->mock( content => sub { 'foo' } );
    $Mock_resp->mock( code => sub { 201 } );

    # Validate args passed to request constructor
    is_deeply $Mock_request->new_args, \@expected_args;
    
    # Validate request headers
    is_deeply [ $Mock_req->next_call ],
              [ 'header', [ 'Accept', 'text/plain' ] ];

    # Special User Agent Behaviour
    $Mock_ua->mock( request => sub { die 'foo' } );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package arises from duplicating the same code to mock LWP et al in
several different modules I've written.  This version is very minimalist, but
works for my needs so far.  I'm very open to new suggestions and improvements.

=head1 EXPORTS

The following variables are exported by default:

=item $Mock_ua
